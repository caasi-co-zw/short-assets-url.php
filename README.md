# Shorten Assests Url

Use short urls to link your theme assets

## Usage

In your custom theme, simply call or link your assests as shown:

css

```html
<link href="/css/file_name.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

javascript

```html
<script src="/js/file_name.js">
```

images

```html
<img src="/img/filename.png" alt="..." />
```

You don't have to type the full path to your assets, the plugin will do that.

all you have to do is make sure your assets are in /wp-content/themes/*your_theme*/*assets* or in your theme root under respective names eg. wp-content/themes/*your_theme*/*css*.
